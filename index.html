                <h2>Mission</h2>
                <p>I'd like to work as a Web Developer Intern/Employee for a Tech Company after completing the course, that is my main mission. Besides completing this online course, I'll have to keep an eye on my academic CGPA. To get the maximum out of that too, I need to put up a comparable amount of work..</p>

                <h2>Vission</h2>
                <p>While looking for a job and a career, I want to make sure that I continue to learn and improve. Not only do I want to keep learning, but I also want to help others grow and allow them be around me because this boosts my confidence and makes me feel valuable..</p>

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>Since beginning this course, I've been quite engaged with my hard work, completing everyday tasks. So I want my 2022 to be fruitful because if it isn't, my 2022 dreams of becoming a web developer would be affected. Furthermore, I must have a positive mindset and practice on a regular basis, to fullfil my wish</p>
